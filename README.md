# Edit Makefile first.
# How to edit Makefile:
## In Notepad, use Ctrl+F to find CROSS_COMPILE	?=/home/deadmau5/toolchain/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/bin/aarch64-linux-android- (that is mine, for example) and change it to your folder.
## Find Clang (using /clang/ in search box for easy), like CROSS_COMPILE, copy paste your directory link to clang folder.
## Find CLANG_TRIPLE, do as the above and done.


# Add more I/O Scheduler, whatever,.. I don't care.

## How-to make kernel:

```
```
export CLANG_TRIPLE=/your_directory_to_clang/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
```
```
export ANDROID_MAJOR_VERSION=q
```
