 * When CONFIG_BOOGER is not defined, we generate a (... 1, 0) pair, and when
 * the last step cherry picks the 2nd arg, we get a zero.

 * As of gcc 3.4, static functions that are not marked with attribute((used))
 * may be elided from the assembly file.  As of gcc 3.4, static data not so
 * marked will not be elided, but this may change in a future gcc version.
 *
 * NOTE: Because distributions shipped with a backported unit-at-a-time
 * compiler in gcc 3.3, we must define __used to be __attribute__((used))
 * for gcc >=3.3 instead of 3.4.
 *
 * In prior versions of gcc, such functions and data would be emitted, but
 * would be warned about except with attribute((unused)).
 *
 * Mark functions that are referenced only in inline assembly as __used so
 * the code is emitted even though it appears to be unreferenced.

/*
 * From the GCC manual:
 *
 * Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments,
 * and have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is
 * just slightly more strict class than the `pure' attribute above,
 * since function is not allowed to read global memory.
 *
 * Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
 * data pointed to must _not_ be declared `const'.  Likewise, a
 * function that calls a non-`const' function usually must not be
 * `const'.  It does not make sense for a `const' function to return
 * `void'.
